And with it comes another season of NBC's hit The Voice. While the format of the competition show will overall stay the same, the series is once again shaking things up in the judges (officially known as coaches) row. Here are all the key details about the new season that we know so far:The Voice season 15 stars Monday, September 24 at 8 p.m. View this post on Instagram Let the countdown begin! ?????????? #TheVoice A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Jun 19, 2018 at 11:54am PDT Warning you now: Monday, September 24 is going to be all about the TV premieres. Apart from The Voice coming back on NBC, The Big Bang Theory (CBS), Young Sheldon (CBS), and Dancing With the Stars (ABC) all return that same night (and, unfortunately all right around the same time). Your DVR will be your lifesaver that night, so better hop to buying one if you're without. Related Story LIST: The Full Fall TV Premiere Schedule The show will air two times a week.

First, the coaches will select their team of artists during the "Blind Auditions" round. Next, two performers from the same team will go head-to-head, while coaches are only allowed to pick one to go to the next round. The third part, also known as "The Knockouts," again pit teammates against one another, though this time the singer gets to make their own song selection. Then come "The Playoffs," where the top 20 compete to secure a spot on the live shows. Finally, the top 12 artists battle it out live each week until the public chooses one winner of The Voice.The Voice coaches are changing ... sort of.

"You're wearing a Canadian tuxedo!"Blake and Adam aside, joining the row of red swivel chairs is American Idol star Jennifer Hudson. She will be next to her longtime pal Kelly Clarkson to round out the coaching panel for season 15. Jennifer had previously served as a coach back in season 13 and was on The Voice UK last season.

Just like in season 14, each coach will have the ability to employ a "block," which means they can stop another coach from getting an artist to join their team.Of course, the "block" twist adds a bit more fun and a dramatic element to the show. But many believe it's not really fair to the contestants and results in some singers not choosing their mentors. Nevertheless, it's for sure coming back, so coaches better be on their toes and choose to use it wisely.Keith Urban and Thomas Rhett are joining as battle advisors for the coaches.Besides Blake Shelton, The Voice is getting even more of country music influence during the "Battle Rounds" of the competition. To help out the "Honey Bee" singer, Keith Urban will serve as a celebrity advisor on his team. Meanwhile, Kelly is reportedly getting Thomas Rhett as a helping hand with her team of 12 artists. This marks the first time Thomas has been tapped by The Voice (or by any major reality competition show, for that matter) to be a coach. You might remember that Keith once appeared as a judge on American Idol.
